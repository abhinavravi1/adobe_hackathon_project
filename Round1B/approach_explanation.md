# Adobe Hackathon Round 1B Approach Explanation

## Approach Overview
Our solution implements a persona-driven semantic analysis system that processes multiple collections of PDF documents to extract relevant information based on user personas and job tasks. The system follows a multi-step approach to ensure accurate and contextually relevant information extraction.

## Key Components

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- Utilizes PyMuPDF (fitz) for efficient PDF text extraction
- Handles various PDF structures and formats
- Extracts text while preserving document structure and hierarchy
- Processes documents in parallel for improved performance

### 2. Semantic Analysis Engine
- Employs sentence-transformers with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
- Performs semantic embeddings of text sections
- Uses cosine similarity for ranking sections based on relevance
- Maintains CPU-only operation for portability

### 3. Persona-Driven Analysis
- Integrates persona information into semantic analysis
- Creates context-aware embeddings for better relevance
- Ranks sections based on persona-job alignment
- Provides granular subsection analysis

### 4. Output Generation
- Structured JSON output following specified schema
- Maintains document context and page references
- Includes importance rankings for sections
- Provides detailed subsection analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Model Selection
- Chose all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for its:
  - Small size (~200MB)
  - Excellent performance on semantic tasks
  - CPU compatibility
  - Fast inference times

### Performance Optimization
- Implemented batch processing for efficiency
- Optimized text extraction to minimize memory usage
- Used efficient data structures for storage
- Maintained processing time under 60 seconds

### Quality Assurance
- Ensures semantic relevance through cosine similarity
- Maintains document context in all outputs
- Provides granular subsection analysis
- Includes proper metadata and timestamps
